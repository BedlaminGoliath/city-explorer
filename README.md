## Overview

The problem Domain: This is for any active traveler who is looking to travel to any city. The user would be able to come to this site, and within a search bar they could type in their city of choice, after typing their city they would be able to see the cities weather and the any movies that might involve said city.

## Getting Started

So I would need to have access to an API, then I would use reach to build a form that way I would be able to access the users input and make a call to the location API that way I can retrieve that info and then use React to render that info/ image.
